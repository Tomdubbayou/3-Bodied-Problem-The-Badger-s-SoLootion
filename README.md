# 3-Bodied Problem & The Badger’s SoLootion

**Mathematically stable solution to the 3-body problem using spiral-compatible orbits.**  
This is the foundational step in testing and validating Badger’s Law through classical physics.

## 🧪 Summary

This simulation uses only Newtonian gravity (`solve_ivp`, `scipy`) to reproduce the rare but stable **figure-eight solution** to the 3-body problem. It includes:

- Full numerical integration  
- Symmetric, equal-mass bodies  
- 2D plot of motion  
- 3D plot with time as the vertical axis (to visualize spiral-like resonance)

✅ No spiral bias added — yet  
✅ Clean, reproducible  
✅ Honors classical mechanics while revealing hidden symmetry

## 💡 Why It Matters

The 3-body problem is historically chaotic and unsolved in general form.  
This repo demonstrates that even under classical conditions, **spiral-compatible harmony naturally emerges**.

This simulation serves as the:
- **Mathematical baseline** before adding spiral bias fields
- **Proof of balance** in chaotic gravitational systems
- **Bridge** from physics into the SoLootion — a survival-first model rooted in dynamic stability

## 🌀 Next Steps

1. Extend the Lagrangian with a spiral-bias term:  
   `+ ½ λ m ( ṙ - k r θ̇ )²`
2. Run the same 3-body setup under spiral tension (λ > 0)
3. Observe divergence or resonance changes
4. Expand to SoLootion: modeling food/shelter/water as orbiting bodies in dynamic balance
